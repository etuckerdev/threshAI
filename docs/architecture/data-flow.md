## Steps in Data Flow

1. **Prompt Input**:
   - **Source**: CLI or Web Interface
   - **Description**: Users input prompts through the command-line interface (CLI) or web-based interface.

2. **Prompt Engine**:
   - **Component**: Prompt Engine
   - **Description**: The prompt engine processes the input prompt, applying any necessary transformations or optimizations. This includes tokenization, context enhancement, and any custom plugins that modify the prompt.

3. **Monitoring**:
   - **Component**: Monitoring System
   - **Description**: Real-time monitoring tracks the performance and health of the system. Metrics such as execution time, resource usage, and error rates are collected and logged.

4. **Output**:
   - **Component**: CLI or Web Interface
   - **Description**: The processed output is returned to the user through the CLI or web interface.

## Detailed Flow

### Step 1: Prompt Input
- **User Action**: Inputs a prompt via the CLI or web interface.
- **System Action**: The input is captured and passed to the prompt engine.

### Step 2: Prompt Processing
- **Component**: Prompt Engine
- **Actions**:
  - Tokenization: Breaks down the prompt into manageable tokens.
  - Context Enhancement: Adds relevant context to the prompt based on predefined rules or machine learning models.
  - Plugin Execution: Applies any custom plugins that modify the prompt.

### Step 3: Monitoring
- **Component**: Monitoring System
- **Actions**:
  - Metrics Collection: Collects performance metrics such as execution time, resource usage, and error rates.
  - Logging: Logs the collected metrics for analysis and debugging.

### Step 4: Output
- **Component**: CLI or Web Interface
- **Actions**:
  - Display: The processed output is displayed to the user.
  - Feedback: Any relevant feedback or error messages are communicated back to the user.

## Conclusion
The data flow in threshAI ensures that prompts are processed efficiently and effectively, with real-time monitoring to ensure system health and performance.
